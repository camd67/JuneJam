# JuneJam

> Theme: **Stacking**

# How to play
- `WASD` - Move
- `Esc` - Quit
- `R` - Hold to reset level
- `Left Click` - Fire blaster

MacOS and Windows builds can be found on the release page.

# Things I got done
- Cool aesthetic (thanks to assets from https://kaylousberg.itch.io/)
- At least 1 "stacking" mechanic
- At least 1 enemy type
- Some experience with animations

# Things I did not get done
- More expansive level
- Difficulty curve
- Instructions
- Sound

Overall I thought this month was good on mechanics, but not so good on final polish and content.
